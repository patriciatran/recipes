# [renv](/software/R/renv)

Container definition files for reproducing an R environment using the [renv package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/). 

# Overview

**Who does this apply to?** Users familiar with running RStudio locally on their machine but wish to begin scaling their analyses on the HTC system will need to recreate a container containing the R dependencies for their code. 


**Overall steps**: To create a container that contains everything from your local RStudio instance, you will need to first create a snapshot of your packages using the `renv` package. 

Then you will transfer the files necessary (`activate.R`, `renv.lock` and `setting.json`) from your laptop to your CHTC home directory. 

Then, on CHTC, you will need to create an Apptainer container by submitting an interactive HTCondor job. This will result in a `SIF` file, which is the container file containing the software and its dependencies (in this case a specific version of R & the R packages needed to run your code). You will move this `SIF` file to your CHTC `/staging/netid` folder. 

After that you can use your container path in any HTCondor submit file.

Next time you want to use the same R/R package containers, you will not need to recreate the container (laptop renv snapshot, interactive build job), but rather only need to specify the path to the staging file.

# Step-by-step

## 1. Obtain the necessary files using `renv`. 

There are several files (`renv.lock`, `activate.R` and `settings.json`) that you need to generate in order to duplicate your R environment.

On your computer, open RStudio, and install the `renv` package. There are two ways to set it up: by typing commands, or by using the Rstudio Interface. Use either of the two options, but not both.

1. **In your project, install the `renv` package (skip if already installed)**

   Run the following command in your R console:

   ```
   install.packages("renv")
   ```

> [!NOTE] 
> The console is the box where you can type commands interactively. This is not the same as typing this in the saved R file containing your code. More information [here](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/code/console.html)

2. **Initialize version tracking.**
   **Make sure you run this command in the R project folder with the scripts that you want to use.**
   There should be a `.Rproj` file in the directory with your scripts; if not, go to "File" > "New project..." to create a one.

   This command will create a directory and several other files in your project folder, and automatically detect the packages you are loading in your Rscripts.

   For an existing project, you initialize the `renv` tracking by typing the following code in your R console:

   ```
   library(renv)
   renv::init()
   ```

   Then enter `y` to confirm you want to initialize the environment.

>[!WARNING] If your R script contains a syntax error, `renv` won't be able to scan that file!
> If there are syntax errors, the `init` command should print warning messages before asking if you want to proceed.
> We recommend that you do *not* proceed.
> Instead, fix the specified syntax errors and try again.

Alternatively, you can click File > New Project > Check the box for initializing the renv project > Create Project.

3. **Continue working on project**

   If your project is still in development, continue as you normally would, including installing packages and writing code in a Rmd or R file.
   Once you are satisfied your code is ready, go to the next step to create a snapshot of your environment.

4. **Capture a "snapshot" of your project environment**

   Assuming that your environment is set up to your satisfaction, and that you have already initialized the `renv` environment (see step 2 above), then you can record the packages and versions your scripts need with the following command in the R console:

   ```
   library(renv)
   renv::snapshot()
   ```

   As mentioned in the warning in Step 2, this process cannot scan files with R syntax errors.

## Transfer the necessary files from your laptop to CHTC

5. **Copy necessary files**

   You local R project now have 3 files that need to be transferred to CHTC's access point.

   The command from the previous step updated several files.
   These files are required to replicate your environment:

   * `project_folder/renv.lock`
   * `project_folder/renv/activate.R`
   * `project_folder/renv/settings.json`

To transfer file to your CHTC folder, use the `scp` command:

For example, if you have a folder `/home/netid/project` on CHTC, and you want to move your files from your laptop to there, type:
e.g.
```
scp project_folder/renv.lock [netID]@[address]:/home/netid/project/.
scp project_folder/renv/activate.R [netID]@[address]:/home/netid/.
scp project_folder/renv/settings.json [netID]@[address]:/home/netid/.
```

## Code and test the Rscript that you will eventually want to run on CHTC

6. **Create an executable .R script.**

If you wrote your script in a `.R` file, you will transfer this file to your `home` folder on the access point.

If you wrote your script in an Markdown `Rmd` file, convert it to an `R` file first. To do that, you can strip your `Rmd` file and turn it into a `R` file by typing this in your RConsole on your laptop:

```
knitr::purl("script.Rmd")
```

(Replace script.Rmd with the name of your choice)

This creates a file named `script.R`. Transfer this file onto CHTC as well.

Transfer the `script.R` file to the desired location in your CHTC `/home/netid/project` folder.

```
scp project_folder/script.R [netID]@[address]:/home/netid/project/.
```

## Building the R container on CHTC

You can choose to build the container using Docker or Apptainer. The instructions below are for Apptainer. 

>[!NOTE]
> If you choose this route, you do not have to install Docker on your laptop at all.

### Instructions for Apptainer

These steps are done **logged in** to the CHTC access point.

>[!TIP]
> See [our guide](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/apptainer-htc) for more information on building Apptainer containers on the HTC system.

Login to your CHTC access point, and create a folder that contains the `.lock`, `.R.` and `.json files`.

Get also a copy of the .def file from the [`chtc/recipes/software/R/env/renv.def`](./renv.def) page.

Get a copy of a `build.sub` file and place it in the same folder. A `build.sub` example is found at the CHTC guide here: (https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/apptainer-htc#start-an-interactive-build-job)

Edit the `build.sub` file to **match the R version** in your `renv.lock` file with the `From:` line from the `.def` file.

For example:
```
grep 'Version' renv.lock | head -n 1
#     "Version": "4.4.0",

grep 'From:' renv.def
# From: rocker/r-ver:4.4.0
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
> See the [rocker/r-ver tags page](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/r-ver/tags) to see which versions of R are available and adjust the `From` line of the recipe file accordingly.  **The version of R you choose must match the version of R you were using when you generated the `renv` files!**


This recipe assumes that the `renv.lock`, `activate.R`, and `settings.json` files are in the same directory as the definition file.

You can check that the files are in the right location with this command:

```
ls activate.R renv.def renv.lock settings.json
```

If correct, you will just see a printout of the file names.

If incorrect, you will see an error message like `ls: cannot access '<filename>': No such file or directory`. 

**Additionally**, ensure that your `build.sub` file contains the `.lock`, `.R` and the `.json` file in the line `transfer_input_files`:
```
grep 'transfer_input_files' build.sub
# If you have additional files in your /home directory that are required for your container, add them to the transfer_input_files line as a comma-separated list.
#transfer_input_files = activate.R,renv.def,renv.lock,settings.json
```

To begin building your Apptainer container, start an interactive job (`condor_build -i build.sub`) and use the apptainer `build` and `shell` commands to build and test the container. Once the software installation has been tested, move the container to `staging` before exiting the interactive build job.

To use the path to your `renv.sif` file in a HTCondor job, please see: https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/apptainer-htc#use-an-apptainer-container-in-htc-jobs

In summary, 

```
ssh netID@[address].chtc.wisc.edu
# Enter your password
# cd into the project folder where you transferred your .lock, .json and activate.R file
cd project 
# make a copy of the renv.def file
wget https://github.com/CHTC/recipes/raw/refs/heads/main/software/R/renv/renv.def
nano renv.def
# IMPORTANT! Edit the R version in your renv.def file to match the one in your renv.lock file. 
# save and exit (ctrl + x, yes, enter)
# get a copy the build template
# go to this website: https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/uw-research-computing/apptainer-htc.html#start-an-interactive-build-job and copy the text in grey into a new file named build.sub
nano build.sub
# paste the build.sub text
# IMPORTANT!! Edit the transfer_input_files = line to say: 
# transfer_input_files = renv.def, activate.R, renv.def, renv.lock, settings.json
# save and exit (ctrl + x, yes, enter)
ls
# You should see activate.R, settings.json, renv.lock, build.sub, renv.def
```

Submit the job interactively:
```
condor_submit -i buid.sub
[enter the interactive job]
apptainer build renv.sif renv.def
apptainer shell -e renv.sif 
# test it
exit
# move the sif file to staging
mv renv.sif /staging/netid/.
# Exit the interactive job
exit
```

# Common errors during the renv container build:

During the `apptainer build` step, you might encounter these errors.

## Linux libraries

Some R packages require specific Linux libraries that are not included in the base container by default.
When `renv` tries to install such an R package, the container build will fail with an error message that looks like this:

```
Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) :
  unable to load shared object '/opt/renv/staging/______':
  LIBRARY.so.NUMBER: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

where `LIBRARY` and `NUMBER` will depend on what the missing library is.

To fix this, you will need to add instructions to the container definition file to install the corresponding `LIBRARY` Linux package (usually named `LIBRARY-dev`).

**Example**:

For example, if the error message during the build is `libfftw3.so.3`, then the LIBRARY name is `libfftw3` according to the syntax above.

Directly inside of the interactive job, you can use nano to edit the `renv.def` file and add these lines below the `%post` line:

```
%post
   chmod 777 /tmp
   apt-get update
   apt-get -y install libfftw3-dev
```

Rebuild your container image:
```
apptainer build renv.sif renv.def
```

>[!NOTE]
> You might need to cycle through the rebuilding steps a few times. Here, it's common to see a "library missing" message, edit the definition file, build the container, and see that another library is missing. Keep adding lines to install the libraries to your %post section and rebuilding until it succeeds. 

## Use your new container in a job

Now that you have a custom-made R container for your project, you can use it in your HTCondor file.

To run an HTCondor job with this new container, the same principle applies as standard jobs: an executable `sh` script, a `submit` file with a `container_image` file path in linking to the `file://staging/netid/renv.sif` container you just created, and in this case an `.R` file that will be run on the remote machine. 

>[!TIP]
> This is a good time to ensure that all your folder is set-up properly for the job to run, including all the files you need

>[!TIP]
> If you are testing your container in a job for the first time, make sure the executable `.R` script written in your HTCondor submit file applies on 1 "instance" of the job your want to run. Recall that HTcondor can queue instances as part of the submit file `queue` statement. This likely means that you need to **modify** the original script that you used and tested on your laptop.
